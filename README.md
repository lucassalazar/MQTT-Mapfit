#MQTT Client using Websockets and Mapfit API

This is a MQTT client for the browser.

#How it works:

The client must be configured to connect with a broker MQTT (It can be Mosquitto) of your preference;
(Obs: The broker have to be configured to connect through Websockets)

Once the connection is made, the client will be capable of receiving coordinate data and print the geolocalization to the map.
